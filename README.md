# Summary AI

**This is currently a work in progress and is not finished yet.** 
Like my physics engine I plan to finish this project by the end of the semester.

**NOTE:** I changed the project from notes to summary AI because I realised it would be very hard getting enough data to make a good AI model.

## About

I plan to develop an AI capable of processing PDF or text files and creating a summary of the document. The summaries will preserve the core information and context. The AI should be able to summarize large and complex documents. The AI will then output a piece of text that can be put into a .txt, .pdf file or raw text.

**Input:** .pdf file or .txt file

**Output:** .pdf file, .txt file, or raw text

**Frontend:** CLI or FastAPI (Haven't fully decied yet)

**Backend:** Python 3.10

**Libraries/Frameworks:** NLTK, spaCy, Tensorflow, PyTorch, scikit

**Database:** MongoDB and .csv file
