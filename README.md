# Note Taker AI

## About

I plan to develop an AI capable of processing PDF or text files, extracting key information, and generating organized, concise notes. The AI will also take guidance text such as questions formatting of notes, etc. The system will automatically summarize the content, highlight the most critical points, and compile the notes into a structured PDF file for easy reference and study.
